\subsection{Deterministic methods}

We choose the method defined in \eqref{numericalODE} within the class of the Runge-Kutta methods, since they have been extensively analyzed theoretically and numerically, providing results which can be exploited in the following of this work. \\
In particular, a method of fourth order is the classic explicit Runge-Kutta method (RK4). It is defined by the following Butcher table

		$1/2$ & $0$ & $1/2$ & & \\
