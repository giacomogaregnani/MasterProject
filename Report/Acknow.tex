\section*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Assyr Abdulle for giving me the opportunity of writing my Master Project under his supervision. His guidance and experience, together with the willingness to let me give my personal imprinting on the direction of this research, have put me in the best position to successfully conclude a Master Thesis. \\
I would like to thank all the members of the ANMC group for the time they dedicated me to discuss various aspects of my project, as well as for the warmth of their welcome in the group. In particular, I have to thank Timoth√©e for the good times we spent together in our shared workspace.

\noindent The biggest thank goes to my mother and my father, your support has been incredible. I may not show it enough, but I will never cease to be grateful for the opportunities you gave me and for your blind faith in my abilities and success. At the same time, I would like to thank my big brother Edoardo. Life would have been much more difficult without you being there to open all the roads for me.

\bigskip
\noindent I have to thank all my friends who have been there for me during the last two years. Edoardo, Luca, Francesco, Philippe, Filippo, you are responsible for making these years at EPFL an unforgettable experience.
