\section*{Abstract}

In this project we focus on the probabilistic interpretation of the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. In particular, our main concern is investigating the properties of a probabilistic integrator which is a natural expansion of traditional deterministic methods. While strong and weak convergence of the obtained numerical solution have been studied, literature lacks a rigorous investigation of the properties of Monte Carlo estimators given by this novel numerical scheme. In this work, we prove results of convergence of Monte Carlo estimators in the mean square sense when the deterministic component of the probabilistic integrator is given by a Runge-Kutta method. Finally, we consider Bayesian inference inverse problems involving differential equations, studying the applications of the probabilistic integrator in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.
