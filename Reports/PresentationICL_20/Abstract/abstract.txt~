We present a novel filtering technique for estimating the drift function of a diffusion process. We suppose data comes from a two scales overdamped Langevin model and we aim at fitting the homogenized equation, thus dealing with an issue of model misspecification. In this setting, we show that if the continuous multiscale data are not pre-processed, then maximum likelihood estimators converge asymptotically on the wrong value of the drift. Conversely, we show that data can be processed ahead of inference in order to obtain the desired drift coefficient. In particular, we prove that there exists a family of linear filters of the exponential family which, used as a pre-processer, . We present a series of numerical examples on test cases which corroborate our theoretical findings.
