\section*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Assyr Abdulle for his supervision and support during my Master Project, and all the members of ANMC for welcoming me in the group and giving me advice on my work. Moreover, I would like to thank my parents and family for their unconditional support during the last two years. Finally, I would like to thank all my friends at EPFL, in particular Edoardo, Filippo, Francesco, Luca and Philippe, who contributed to making these years in Lausanne an unforgettable experience. \\[1cm]
