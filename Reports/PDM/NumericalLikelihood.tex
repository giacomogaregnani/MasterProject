\subsubsection{Numerical experiment - Likelihood}

We consider the FitzHug-Nagumo problem defined in \eqref{eq:FitzNag} and the parameters fixed to the true value $\bar\theta = (0.2, 0.2, 3.0)$. We generate ten equispaced observations from initial time $t = 0$ to final time $T = 1$ adding a zero-mean Gaussian perturbation with variance equal to $10^{-2}$ to the two components of a numerical solution computed with a small time step. Then we generate a reference solution using the same small time step without noise in order to have an approximation of $\diffL(\mathcal{Y}|\bar \theta)$ with negligible error. We compute 300 realizations of $\diffL_h^M(\mathcal{Y}|\bar \theta)$ using EE or RK4 as a deterministic integrator and the noise scale $p = q$ with time steps $h$ in the set $h = 0.1\cdot 2^{-i}$ with $i = 0, \ldots, 11$, for Euler Forward and $h = 0.1\cdot2^{-i}$ for $i = 0, \ldots, 6$, for RK4. Moreover, we consider $M = 10$ trajectories for all time steps, since the convergence rates with respect to $h$ should be observed independently of $M$. Hence, we can estimate the bias of $\diffL_h^M(\mathcal{Y}|\bar \theta)$ with respect to the true value of the likelihood and its variance. Results (Figure \ref{fig:LikelihoodApprox}) show that the bound \eqref{eq:likMSE} is verified in practice. Therefore, we can treat the likelihood function as any other functional $\phi$ of the solution and apply the theoretical results presented in Section \ref{sec:MonteCarlo}.
